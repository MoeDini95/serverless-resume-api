    "summary": "A research about Somali youth within the GTA and their sense of belongingness within their families, community, and schools. Throughout the years, it is evident that Somali youth face many challenges within the categories listed, which is why I decided to take part in this study. I tend to dig deep and figure out why these challenges exist through one on one interviews and outline why the level of support does not exist for our youth."
